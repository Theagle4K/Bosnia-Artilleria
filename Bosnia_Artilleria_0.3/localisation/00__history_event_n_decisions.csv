EVTDESC31001;In the colonial era, English crown under the rule of British have been permitted to discover and colonize the new world as they desired, independently. Due to Portuguese presence in the south, English colonies were based around Lower Canada and New England. These colonies got independent following the revolutions happening in Mexico and Andies. These colonies united under the Virginian crown. But Anglican people who escaped to the new world from the mass conversions the British crown has enforced was not happy of catholic Virginian rule and has started a secessionist revolution, causing series of civil wars between Anglicana and Virginia. Anglicana has won the initial war and the many more came after it, but Virginia still exists, and thus the civil war still continiues.;x

EVTDESC31002;In the colonial era, English crown under the rule of British have been permitted to discover and colonize the new world as they desired, independently. Due to Portuguese presence in the south, English colonies were based around Lower Canada and New England. These colonies got independent following the revolutions happening in Mexico and Andies. These colonies united under the Virginian crown. Virginia has fought over left over colonies all around North America to enforce its true legitimacy but it failed due to mistreating its own people, leading up to a civil war where Virginia lost 90 percent of its territory. Now Anglicana wanting to take place of the old Virginia is getting stronger day by day. Virginia itself one day wishes to go back and unite with England, freeing their brothers from British crown.;x

EVTDESC31003;French was one of the colonial powers that had influence in the area. After failing to settle in South America due to Portuguese influence, they have taken matters to hand by invading Spain and forcing them to transfer colonial holdings like Cobana, Hispagnolie, and Floride. France rather than having a more spread colonial policy, they focused on Caribbean trade and expanded upon controlling more of Cree controlled areas. Nouvellia got its independence in a harsh war, with England already having most of its colonies lost at this point, they funded all the colonies that fought against France, and giving them an idea of unified Nouvellia that controls the trade and cotton that comes from North America. Now being a quite young of a country, Nouvellia struggles to find its place.;x

EVTDESC31004;§RTo keep the HIE together, one must not lose Great Power, one must not get let Southern Romans control Northern Romans, one must not let any HIE country become a Great Power and one must eliminate Bavaria at all cost.§! Switzerland is the emperor of Holy Italian Empire, which itself is made off of bunch of other smaller kingdoms around German and North Roman regions. Switzerland monarchy was elected as the new emperor in 1482 as Austria started to lose more power due to late emperor having issues to make an heir for the throne, leading to internal conflicts which lasted for years end ended up with making Austria the first and only republic in the Empire. Switzerland however gaining more and more power in the Empire, gaining Personal unions over Bohemia and Burgundy. Now Switzerland has complete control over the Empire, but due to War of Francaes, which led to the creation of Austrasia, Switzerland is challanged to keep the Empire together. Time will tell if German and Roman Nationalism will be succesfull to unify their respective countries, or Monarchism will once again enforce its will on the people.;x

EVTDESC31005;§ROne must free themselves from HIE to make their dreams come true.§! Austrasia or Westphalia, is first attempt of a nation state in the Holy Italian Empire. It was founded after the War of Francaes, thanks to France and Britain having an upper hand against the Emperor, who has outgrown its usefulness to European continent. Even if the Emperor tried to disassamble our kingdom, we still stand strong to challange the Emperor, and unify our people under one banner!;x

EVTDESC31006;§ROne must free themselves from HIE to make their dreams come true.§! Lowlands were for a long time controlled by the emperor. Burgundian throne was inherited by the Bretany first and then it was freed by the emperor. This region always have been a region of war and destruction. In the War of Francaes, Lowlands were freed from the emperor once again, but only for the condition that these lands would gain high autonomy, while still staying in the empire. Bretons at first, didn't like this idea but then it was an opportunity to control one of the states and crack the empire from inside. But fortunately for us, it was Liege who was supported by the emperor who united much of the lowlands, except for Scandinavian Trade Hub. Liege is a higly militaristic nation, that doesn't have an idea what to achieve in this world;x

EVTDESC31007;§ROne must free themselves from HIE to make their dreams come true.§! South Germany has been the strongest part of the empire and the region emperor had most influence over. Due to this situation, Bavaria itself was quite peaceful. It unified under the influence of Bavaria due to emperor's reforms. These autonomous country-influence hybrids which led to one dominant country protecting and taking care of all the smaller towns in similar region, working together to make the empire look more like a nation-state. But recently Bavaria has been more rebellious towards the emperor, because of the effects of industrial revolution taking place in Roman Peninsula, spreading to Bavaria, and Bavaria obtaining more economical freedom and leading Germany towards industrialization. Bavaria's destiny is one that comes from cooperation, like always has been;x

EVTDESC31008;Trislavia is a country made up of union between Slovincia, Poland and Ukraine. In the 15th century, Slovincians(Pomeranians) were under Germans, and Polish were the stronger power in Central Europe. With their influence all over the East, they came to under a union with Lithuanians, forming Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This union being highly Polish centric, focuses more on the goals of the old Polish Kingdom, rather than acting as a union, causing Lithuanians and Ruthenians to causing unrest throughout the country. Polish people that have ran out of allies to help them in 17th century, ask Slovincians for help, starting a complicated relationship between two nations. This union evolves into a union of three nations, Slovincians who have similar amount of control as Polish, and Ukranians who were given an opportunity to take control of their own lands. Trislavia hence found itself in this situation of overcomplicated chess game, where every political action meant disturbance in the balance of power.;x

EVTDESC31009;Russia started as one of the vassals under the Golden Horde, with the fall of Golden Horde it capitalized the opportunity to grow stronger and go east, to prevent anyone from invading. But Russia was powerless and poor. It needed the help of the tatars against its enemy, who were not keen on working with Russia, but they had similar enemies, like Bosnia and Poland-Lithuania. After for many years losing wars to Poland and Scandinavia, Russia was trapped between enemies who are much more stronger than it, and tatars, who started to have much more influence over the country than Russians. But thankfully previous enemies have been falling weak, rebelions both in Scandinavia and Bosnia has exhausted them, leaving Trislavia alone against Russia. Even if Russia is technologically and economically backwards compared to Trislavia, it has the manpower to make up for it;x
