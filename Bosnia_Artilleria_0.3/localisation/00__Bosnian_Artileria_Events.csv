EVTDESC37300;Inside our state, there are many minorities and duchies who have their own language different than what our constitution is based on.

We need to make sure we have allies and expand towards them, making sure their eyes would fall of their sockets. But one shall not forget about the inner politcs as well. Our kingdom is a constitutional one. We have many parties, many issues and most importantly, our economy is completely dependent on farming unlike southern european states.

EVTNAME27907;Ambitions of an Empire;x
EVTDESC27907;Holy Italian Empire has been unified, and our first deal of business should be to decide which direction our Empire shall be headed. We have gathered the court together and a lot of discussions and arguments about the future of the Empire has occured. Many of our courtiers argued for a peaceful Empire that coexists with rest of Europe like it has done for a long time. On the other hand few seem to feel like they desire more expansion and conquering most of Europe if possible, after all we are the strongest country in Europe, and just like Italian Empire did, we shall bring our neighbors civilization.;x
EVTOPTA27907;Maybe Italy was right all along.;x
EVTOPTB27907;A peaceful coexisting will help everyone!;x
EVTOPTC27907;We could at least unify with out lost long lands.;x
EVTNAME279041;Freedom! And True Neutrality;x
EVTDESC279041;The Empire has been finally came to an end, and with this our tribute to the Emperor. We are now free to follow our neutrality path, but due to international community's pressures, we needed to give up our claims to the Emperors Passage, due to it being too important of a gap point for the Empire and for Bavarians.;x
EVTOPTA279041;True neutrality requires sacrifices;x
EVTNAME270000;Freedom!;x
EVTDESC270000;Our liege is currently facing a crisis that has led to our freedom, we shall take an advantage of this and become free of our chains;x
EVTOPTA270000;Freedom shall no longer await;x
EVTOPTB270000;We cannot betray our liege;x
EVTNAME313100;Crisis in Sejm;x
EVTDESC313100;The Great Sejm, our parliament, has been greatly effected by the corruption that has been slowly leaching into the monarch. First absolute power to the monarch, and then no elections has shown that Sejm has no intention to stop Slovincians from taking power of our lands, which are a minority in our country. Due to Slovincians being richer than Poles and Ruthenians, they can get away with more favors in Sejm than everyone else. Our prime minister, who has been working the hardest to deal with this corruption, and a non-slav himself, is now being asked to replaced with other candidates which the monarch seems to be more inclined towards.;x
EVTOPTA313100;A Slovincian PM of Danstadt will make sure to enrich the "Commonwealth";x
EVTOPTB313100;An inexperienced Polish candidate from Wilno will fit fine with our policies;x
EVTOPTC313100;Someone with a farmer background of Polesie region will understand the folk!;x
EVTOPTD313100;Our Minister is fine as is;x
EVTNAME31311;Our King is Dead!;x
EVTDESC31311;Our king has been found dead in his charter. This unfortunate event was unexpected, he was a young and healthy man, yet his time came for him. This has sparked multiple questions among his realm. Due to he having absolute power over the realm, now many places find themselves plunging into chaos. Some cities have risen up, established their own city councils. Luckly the king had an heir to the throne, but he's too young to be the ruler, and her mother is not in a stable situation to be a regent.;x
EVTOPTA31311;Make the child the king;x
EVTOPTB31311;The regent should be the Prime Minister;x
EVTNAME313112;Emperor Comes to Age!;x
EVTDESC313112;Our emperor who was throned when he was a small child, has now grown to be a big boy, who will rule the nation, and has the control and the skill to do so. He was very smart since he was little, he learnt the manners of reign with ease. And now he's crowned to be the supreme ruler of our nation, and he shall give us an example how to be a successful nation!;x
EVTOPTA313112;A smart boy doing smart things?;x
EVTNAME313113;End of the Tripact?;x
EVTDESC313113;Despite our effords, chaos and corrution has spread deep in the Trislavia, causing unrest to local population. With the rise of nationalism in Germany and Rome, our region has also been effected by this nationalism and the idea of unified slavic state doesn't fit with everyone anymore. Ukrainians who would rather be unified with their Eastern brothers, Russians, and Polish people who have been demanding more rights in the rule of the nation have come to an agreement to overthrow the Slovincian regime that has been cursing this geography once and for all;x
EVTOPTA313113;We shall crush these rebellious scum;x

EVTDESC313114;The Polish nation has seceded from our union, putting our union in an extremely though spot. We shall restore our glory and show them rebelion what it means to revolt against us;x
EVTOPTA313114;For the Union!;x
EVTNAME313115;Restoration of the Union;x
EVTDESC313115;After a bloody rebelion, we have finally put polish rebelions to their places. Even if this means giving polish more rights and influence over the state, we protected our Union and that's all that matters.;x
EVTOPTA313115;Glory for the Union!;x
EVTNAME31312;Polish Demonstrations;x
EVTDESC31312;Polish people, who have been a big majority in our de jure lands have been telling us that they feel oppressed and powerless due to how strong of an economical and political influence Slovincians carry over the realm. Due to this, some polish nationalist parties decided to organize protests all over the majority parts of the nation, and most importantly, in Warsaw. These protests for now seem harmless but it causes pressure on the Sejm, and most importantly on the monarch which seem to favor Slovincians to the Polish.;x
EVTOPTA31312;Support the Demonstrations;x
EVTOPTB31312;Take heavy cautions, do whatever is necessary to keep them in place;x
EVTNAME313121;Peaceful Demonstrations;x
EVTDESC313121;The Polish Demonstrations have gone successfully, with no one getting hurt and no group fighting eachother. No vandalism, and the police forces had accompanied many of the demonstrators without any kind of violence occuring between the sides. It's well proven that our nation regardless of the politics, cares about opinions of its common citizens, and shall become an example of human rights, and much more for other european nations to adapt and realize in their own states;x
EVTOPTA313121;Look how civilized we are!;x
EVTNAME313122;Violent Demonstrations;
EVTDESC313122;Unfortunately the demonstrations have gone terrible, A lot of violence has happened in many cities and Polish people and parties all united against the Sejm and the monarch who seems to be prefering Slovincians over them. This has led to some international reaction, as the protests turned red and more violent, more our country is reflected as a backwards nation. Many of our slavic neighbours have condemned us. Not sure where this is going to lead us but many of our MPs are afraid that this might lead to a rebellion;x
EVTOPTA313122;Shameful, Honestly;x
EVTNAME313123;Bloody Thursday of Warsaw;x
EVTDESC313123;The mass protests that have been going on in Polish parts of our realm gone really violent. Some group of terrorist organizations have tried to overthrow the Sejm, via organizing an attack in the Parliament. This situation has led to us using our military force to deal with protestors, causing a massive conflict between the sides and resulting in thousands of deaths. This event that took place in Warsaw let every Polish national movement now that the direct action towards government could result in a massive conflict which the Polish people are not keen on acting upon anymore. Maybe it was a loss of prestige and a lot of people but this has secured our control over the Polish population.;x
EVTOPTA313123;It had to be done;x
EVTNAME313124;End of the Tripact?;x
EVTDESC313124;Despite our effords, chaos and corrution has spread deep in the Trislavia, causing unrest to local population. With the rise of nationalism in Germany and Rome, our region has also been effected by this nationalism and the idea of unified slavic state doesn't fit with everyone anymore. Ukrainians who would rather be unified with their Eastern brothers, Russians, and Slovincians, who are upset due to losing control in the government have come to an agreement to overthrow the Polish regime that has been cursing this geography once and for all;x
EVTOPTA313124;We shall crush these rebellious scum;x

EVTOPTA313125;For the Union!;x
EVTNAME313126;Restoration of the Union;x
EVTDESC313126;After a bloody rebelion, we have finally put Slovincian rebelions to their places. Even if this means more economical issues in the future due to many Slovincians escaping, we protected our Union and that's all that matters.;x
EVTOPTA313126;Glory for the Union!;x
EVTNAME31313;Pan-Slavism;x
EVTDESC31313;Panslavism is an ideology that has recently gained momentum in our Ruthenian lands. Due to the extensive influence of Russian Empire, many of our subjects want to be united with their close relatives, rather than living under our realm. This being concerning for us, can also be the means of ways for us to expand our Empire towards eastwards. Russia seems to be happier about this news, their Empire, being mostly based around the lands of old Muscovy and grew with the power of Tatar kingdoms, is still not considered a European Empire, hence they will be also willing to cease this chance;x
EVTOPTA31313;Matters of Eastern Slavs don't matter to us;x
EVTOPTB31313;Maybe we can also try to cease this chance?§RKievan Rus Path§!;x
EVTNAME313131;Unification of Ruthenias;
EVTDESC313131;Our vassal, Lithuania, has been controlling some Ruthenian lands ever since middle ages, and they as a non-slavic kingdom, always retained their sense of authority in their lands. But with the growth of Pan-Slavism in our nation, many of Ruthenians amongst our population have asked to unify with their Belarusian brothers. So we have come to the Lithuanian court, demanding for such unification for the times we have protected and respected their soverreignty;x
EVTOPTA313131;Send a messanger to Lithuania;x
EVTNAME3131312;Demands from Our Liege;x
EVTDESC3131312;Our liege has send a messanger to our court, asking for us to give up our lands in Belarus, for exchange of possible freedom. Even though our liege has never disrespected our authority, we can sense that if we were to refuse this, we have no where else to ask for aid.;x
EVTOPTA3131312;We have to, if we have to;x
EVTNAME313132;Falcon's Nest;x
EVTDESC313132;After our vassal Lithuania has allowed Ukraine to be unified with rest of Belarus, the momentum has grew to be bigger than any expectations from Pan-Slavism. It's no longer an idea that Eastern Slavs should Unify under one flag, but ALL slavs should unify. From Trislavia to Russia, and from Russia to Bosnia, All slavs shall be unified under our flag which shall lead them to the domination of rest of the Europe. We are unstopabble if we are unified!;x
EVTOPTA313132;Slava vem slovjanskim narodam;x
EVTNAME313133;Stability in our Union;x
EVTDESC313133;Our prime minister who was figting the corruption in our country has finally managed to bring balance to the Sejm. The three nations that make up our nation are united more than ever. Our nation is keeping up with the nations of the west and is strong enough to show dominance in Eastern Europe. Long live the Sejm, Long live the King!;x
EVTOPTA313133;Such a good day to be Trislavian;x
EVTNAME54500;Emperor of the East;x
EVTDESC54500;Our previous emperor who was exiled to Siberia has led an army of his own managed to conquer some parts of China for our nation, and claiming back the throne. Our traders and bureaucrats are unhappy about this rising tension between the factions, so after years of political discussions, it was decided that Ruriks would instead will be given full support to conquer china, but expected nothing in return. No tribute or no integration, just independence. Thankfully, the negotiations went well, and peace has been achieved;x
EVTOPTA54500;Peace in our time;x
EVTNAME54501;Imperial Ambitions;x
EVTDESC54501;After reconquering Ruthenia and proclaiming the Russian Empire, it came to our attention that many places around our state are in a week position, waiting for us to take adventage of those places. But we should also remember that going after more than one of these places might cause an international crisis, which would be heavily stacked against us.;x
EVTOPTA54501;After the Baltics! We need a strong navy;x
EVTOPTB54501;The Caucauses will train better soldiers;x
EVTOPTC54501;Our influences in Central Europe is important;x
EVTNAME27836;End of Tatar Autonomy;x
EVTDESC27836;Russian influence over the state has been on a rise ever since the fall of Scandinavian Kingdom and Bosnian revolutions, economically making russians less and less dependent on Tatars. This situation has led to polarization between Tatars and Russians. The tensions are rising each day, and the states that make up the Tatar kingdom under our rule discuss for the future of coexistance of the state.;x
EVTOPTA27836;We shall fight for our freedom!;x
EVTOPTB27836;Coexistance is the key;x
EVTOPTA27837;We shall restore our order;x
EVTOPTB27837;We need to respect their self determination;x
EVTNAME54503;Heirs of Mongolia;x
EVTDESC54503;Mongol Empire has controlled a big majority of Asia, from China to Anatolia. As one of the heirs of Mongol Empire, we came to a crossroads where we need to decide over where to focus first, we have can claim Anatolia for ourselves, getting closer to Europe, or we can silently deal with Persians, getting our place in central asia. The choice is yours;x`
EVTOPTA54503;Anatolia is where my heart's at;x
EVTOPTB54503;Persia is more important to us;x
